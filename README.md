# Diyetim App

*Here is my new project Diyetim.*


You can log in to the application via email. After entering the application, we will ask you for user information. After entering the user information, you can search for food and drink on the homepage. My diet will list you what you want out of thousands of products. You can see the detail of the product you are looking for and mark the product as eaten. The products that you marked as I ate will be listed on another page. On this page, you can see the total calories of the products you eat and see how many calories you have left. On the profile page, you can see the user picture, name, age, height, weight, and body mass index value. My diet will show health status based on body mass index.
